# Production Readiness Review (PRR)

Date: January 1, 2025  
Reviewer: Claude Code  
Status: **NOT PRODUCTION READY** ⚠️

## Executive Summary

The KataGo MCP server provides core functionality for Go game analysis but lacks several critical components needed for production deployment. While the application has good test coverage and CI/CD pipelines, it needs significant enhancements in observability, reliability, security, and operational tooling.

## Review Categories

### 1. Observability & Monitoring ❌

**Current State:**
- Basic text logging to stderr (unstructured)
- No metrics collection or export
- No distributed tracing
- No health check endpoints
- No performance monitoring

**Gaps:**
- No structured logging (JSON format)
- No metrics for:
  - Request latency
  - KataGo query performance
  - Resource usage (CPU, memory)
  - Error rates
  - Queue depths
- No integration with monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana)
- No alerting configuration
- No request correlation IDs

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement structured logging with JSON output
2. Add OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing
3. Create health check endpoints (/health, /ready)
4. Export Prometheus metrics
5. Add request tracing with correlation IDs

### 2. Error Handling & Recovery ❌

**Current State:**
- Basic error propagation
- KataGo process health checks every 30s
- No automatic recovery mechanisms
- No circuit breakers
- No retry logic with backoff

**Gaps:**
- No automatic KataGo process restart on failure
- No graceful degradation
- No error budget tracking
- Missing retry mechanisms for transient failures
- No dead letter queue for failed requests

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement automatic KataGo restart with backoff
2. Add circuit breaker pattern for KataGo queries
3. Implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. Add graceful shutdown handling
5. Create runbooks for common failure scenarios

### 3. Security & Authentication ❌

**Current State:**
- Basic input validation for SGF and positions
- No authentication mechanism
- No authorization controls
- No rate limiting implementation
- No audit logging

**Gaps:**
- MCP protocol doesn't support auth natively
- No API key management
- No request signing/verification
- No DDoS protection
- No security headers
- No secrets management

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement rate limiting per client
2. Add request validation and sanitization
3. Implement audit logging for all operations
4. Add security scanning to CI/CD
5. Document security best practices

### 4. Deployment & Configuration ⚠️

**Current State:**
- Configuration via JSON file and env vars
- No production Dockerfile
- No Kubernetes manifests
- No infrastructure as code
- Basic build script

**Gaps:**
- No production-optimized container image
- No Helm charts or K8s deployments
- No service mesh integration
- No blue-green deployment support
- No configuration hot-reload

**Recommendations:**
1. Create production Dockerfile with:
   - Multi-stage build
   - Non-root user
   - Security scanning
   - Minimal base image
2. Add Kubernetes manifests:
   - Deployment
   - Service
   - ConfigMap/Secret
   - HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
   - PDB (Pod Disruption Budget)
3. Create Helm chart for easy deployment
4. Add Terraform modules for cloud resources

### 5. Performance & Scalability ⚠️

**Current State:**
- Single KataGo process per instance
- Configurable thread count
- No caching layer
- No connection pooling
- No load testing results

**Gaps:**
- No horizontal scaling strategy
- No caching for repeated queries
- No performance benchmarks
- No capacity planning data
- No SLO/SLA definitions

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement caching layer (Redis) for analysis results
2. Add connection pooling for KataGo communication
3. Create load testing suite
4. Define and monitor SLIs/SLOs
5. Document scaling strategies

### 6. Documentation & Operations ❌

**Current State:**
- Good development documentation
- Basic README
- No operational runbooks
- No incident response procedures
- No deployment guides

**Gaps:**
- No production deployment guide
- No troubleshooting documentation
- No capacity planning guide
- No disaster recovery procedures
- No on-call playbooks

**Recommendations:**
1. Create operational runbooks for:
   - Deployment procedures
   - Common issues and resolutions
   - Performance tuning
   - Backup and recovery
2. Document monitoring and alerting setup
3. Create incident response templates
4. Add architecture decision records (ADRs)

## Priority Action Items

### P0 - Critical (Must have for production)
1. [ ] Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
2. [ ] Add health check endpoints
3. [ ] Create production Dockerfile
4. [ ] Implement rate limiting
5. [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling
6. [ ] Implement KataGo auto-restart with backoff

### P1 - High (Should have soon after launch)
1. [ ] Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation
2. [ ] Implement caching layer
3. [ ] Create Kubernetes manifests
4. [ ] Add performance benchmarks
5. [ ] Write operational runbooks

### P2 - Medium (Nice to have)
1. [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern
2. [ ] Implement blue-green deployments
3. [ ] Create Helm charts
4. [ ] Add request signing for security
5. [ ] Implement distributed tracing

## Conclusion

The KataGo MCP server has a solid foundation but requires significant work before production deployment. The most critical gaps are in observability, reliability, and operational tooling. Addressing the P0 items would bring the service to a minimum viable production state, while P1 and P2 items would improve operability and reliability.

Estimated effort to reach production readiness: 2-3 weeks of focused development.
